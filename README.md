In this Java project, an ATM interface is designed to facilitate banking transactions with a focus on security and user convenience. To access their accounts securely, users must provide a unique ID and corresponding PIN during login. Once authenticated, users are presented with a menu offering options such as Withdraw, Deposit, Display Account Details, Transfer, and Quit.

The interface ensures a smooth banking experience by providing intuitive options for various transactions. Users can withdraw funds, deposit money, view account details to check balances and transaction history, transfer funds between accounts, and exit the system when finished.

Security measures are implemented to safeguard user accounts. The unique ID and PIN combination serves as a secure login mechanism, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access account information and performÂ transactions.
